Camping Simulator is a game to be developed by Matthew Deweese. The game centers around a playable male character Brian who finds himself in an unoccupied valley within Pennsylvania. As this person explores the valley, he finds spots around where others seem to have camped or possibly are actively camping. He's unable to find any other people in the valley but finds garbage, guns, & campsites leftover from others.

## The Character

The Character is the main character of the game, this character moves around with a third-person camera. The camera is very tight and only ever can reach the eye level height of the character. It's not clear how the character made it to where they are. All they have when they wakes up in the valley are pants, a shirt, and a pellet rifle. They can maneuver the landscape by jumping short heights, climbing, walking, & running.

## Story

### Begin State

The game begins by showing a dialog box similar to the styling of LoZ:OoT, showing "..." the only image on the screen is a cool blue gradient, the sound is of a very dull low wind hum, shortly in a few seconds a cloud begins to appear within the view. Continuing the dialog changes the camera angle to point directly downward at the character, they are lying in a dull field with unmoving grass. The sound of bugs slowly begins to fade in until it overtakes the hum of the wind. The character looks surprised but still unmoving, tranfixed looking straight up at the camera. Another dialog appears showing "...". The camera moves 90 degrees in roll showing a side profile of the character lying in the grass, they are still unmoving, very slowly and delayed the character begins to lean upwards. The camera cuts to behind the character at a slight angle. The character looks to their left, they scan the area slowly, and begin to rotate their torso looking to their right slowly trying to parse the situation. The camera slowly plans along facing the characters plane of focus. The character looks down with tehir expression changing from exclaim to puzzlement. The character's eyes come to a dull focus, their eyes still scanning internally, they do not know whats happening.

The camera shifts to being in front of the character 13 feet away, staring straight towards them. The character gets on their feet, standing straight up, then takes one step. That one step fails to plant causing the character to fall back down, the character stops moving face down in the field. The camera cuts to a shot 8 feet in the air, 6 feet from the character, it rotates and pans in a circular pattern while focusing and facing the characters body. Slowly the camera moves up vertically keeping the focus on the character as a title "Camping Simulator" fades in, shortly there after the screen fades to black.

### Dream Sequences

Occasionally on certain actions, Brian will happen upon doorways in the landscape, on entering these landscape it's implied that Brian is currently sleeping. He walks through a narrow hallway. The perspective on the camera distorts, the depth of field locks looking forward. Brian hears fragments of quotes of thoughts and feelings, ongoing through the door the screen fills to pure white, and Brian wakes up in his hammock.

A second type will appear where at the dead of night Brian will happen upon a bridge that seems to be the exit over the mountain, it's a man-made lattice metal enclosure. As he walks through he experiences similar imagery, on getting to the end, the light fades to black and Brian wakes up on his hammock with evidence that someone put him there.

#### Narrow Hallway

While in the woods after 2 hours of playtime in a hill a door is in the cliff. It's a wood door, with wood outer rimming material, and it's connected to what looks like a white-painted box coming out of the cliff. The door is straight-up vertical, as brian approaches the door it opens itself. Inside you can see a very narrow hallway, the floor is made of cheap blue desaturated fuzzy shag carpet. The walls are cheap mock wood material. There are a series of doors in the hallway, they are wood doors with wood outer rimming material. They alternate left side, right side, as Brian walks through the hallway. After passing the first door, the entrance door closes itself and is locked. On turning around brian finds that everything is blurred as he turns around. The camera is incredibly low and tight and Brian can only walk in this hallway. A low rumbling pink noise and increases in volume as Brian approaches the end of the hallway.

There are 8 doors on the left and right side starting on the left, alternating, left door, right door, left door, etc. On passing each door, heavily effected spacy words of dialogue can be heard. "It's not like it's anything anyways" "You can't do that I know you." "It comes to this every single time." "Let's just do what we have to, it doesn't matter at this point." "I swear, just take care of yourself. You do you." "No it's fine, just stop it. Stop." "It has to be this way." "Okay, if that's what you want." After the final 8th door, is the end of the hallway, which is a white wall, with a wooden door. As Brian approaches this door it opens revealing a white glare. Brian walks through the door and falls, the camera pans away from brian, then fully white. In large black font, a large CHAPTER TWO appears on the screen abruptly. CHAP, TER, TWO. The white bg & black text fades to show Brian laying on a hammock hooked to two trees. Brian wakes up, gets up and acquires the Hammock as an item.

### End State

As Brian continues to explore and attempt to figure out who is occupying the campsites and leaving equipment, he eventually happens upon a patch of land where the trees are cleared. Very bizarrely there are incredibly large tracks of trees removed and trampled, 60 feet wide of trees cut over. On climbing the steep mountain, he finds that on top is an incredibly large crane.

## Terrain

The valley is an evergreen area within a valley surrounded by mountains in the distance. There are trees, bushes, grass, tall grass, mud, trails, & mud tracks by vehicles. The area is sprawling but Brian is unable to get past the distant mountains or even scalem them enough to look past them. There is a more forest area, one which is made up of evergreen trees, and the other pine, they touch each other in a way that seems unatural. The pine tree area is much darker with the thicker brush and there are numerous strange holes throughout with large rocks in them.

### Campsites

The character happens upon many campsites that seem to have been recently used. They have leftover food, occasionally weapons, vehicles, crudely built tables & structures. 

They frequently have fires that are still smoldering & wet as through someone was recently there and put it out with water.

Some campsites are trashed and filled with broken beer bottles & crushed aluminum cans.

### Racoon

In the middle of the valley there's a very tall pile of rocks forming a very small cave opening. Inside you can see eyes blinking and looking at you. This will be a raccoon that you eventually use a flashlight to see inside and get an item inside.

### Items

#### Pellet Rifle

The character awakes with a children's daisy dawn pellet rifle. The player can find ammunition in abandoned campsites.

#### Kalashnikov

The character finds an actual budget model of an AK-47 built in Russia. There are only two bullets. This item only spawns once after at least 2 hours of gameplay. No additional ammo can be found for the weapon, and there are no apparent uses for the weapon. At the end of teh game, you find that there was actually a use for those two bullets, if the user has already used them the user will get the bad ending.

#### Small ATV

The Character happens upon a very small 4 Wheeler meant for children. Although the ATV will carry Brian small distances, it's very easily flipped over and bogs down frequently requiring the chains to be fixed reguarly after shifting gears. The vehicle very frequently runs out of gas and cannot be moved. On leaving the area it will be moved by others and some gas will be restored.

#### Other Set Pieces Found

* Hammocks
* Pellets
* Used Toilet Paper Piles
* Strange polygonal geometric structures made out of concrete or rusted refined metals.
